1. Break the Problem into Smaller Pieces (Simple)
This is the golden rule of coding challenges: donâ€™t try to solve the entire problem all at once. Break it into bite-sized pieces and focus on solving one part at a time.
How to Use This:
Identify the inputs, outputs, and constraints.
Break down the task into logical steps or subproblems. Solve each subproblem first.
Once the subproblems are solved, combine the solutions into the final answer.

2. Use Mathematical Insights (Intermediate)
Many coding challenges have mathematical patterns hidden beneath their surface. Recognizing these patterns lets you skip iterative steps and solve the problem with formulas or shortcuts.
How to Use This:
Think about the relationships between numbers in the problem.
Look for things like sums, modular arithmetic, averages, or symmetry.
Use mathematical formulas to simplify calculations.

3. Use Hashing for Fast Lookups (Advanced)
Hashing is a powerful technique when you need to check for duplicates, count occurrences, or quickly access elements. A hash table (or Dictionary/Set in Swift) allows constant time operations like insert, delete, and lookup.
How to Use This:
Use a Set to track unique elements efficiently.
Use a Dictionary to store counts or mappings for elements in the problem.
