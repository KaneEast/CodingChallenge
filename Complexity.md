# Complexity—one of the core ideas of computer science!

O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n²)
O(2ⁿ)


# A Fun Example: Finding a Nameko Mushroom
Let’s say you’re searching for a specific mushroom in a list:
O(1): The mushroom's location is on a map. Quick grab!
O(n): You search the list, one by one.
O(n²): You check every mushroom against others to ensure no duplicates (exhaustive comparison).
